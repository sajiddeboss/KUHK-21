## HEDA - Your Health App
### Diagnostics at your doorsteps
#### Overview
HEDA is Python Script that helps predict the chances of diabetes, malaria or heart disease based on the given criteria. Diabetes and Heart disease prediction models take in numbers as input while Malaria model inputs in Cell images for prediction. The Script has been developed to help ease the diagnostics process for doctors.

All the models and their notebooks along with datasets have been stored in different folders for ease of access.
The input for malaria prediction should be a valid path in order for the code to run. 

 - To minimise the doctor's dependence.
 - To optimise diagnostic accuracy.
 - Increasing the efficacy of practitioners in medical care.

#### Datasets
 1. Malaria Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/miracle9to9/files1
 2. Diabetes Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
 3. Heart Disease Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset
 
#### How to Run
1. Install all the modules mentioned in Requirements.txt
2. Change the directory to the folder containing app.py using Command prompt
3. Run the python script app.py using the command prompt

#### Future Development
1. Adding more disease like Cataract detection using Retina images, Pneumonia detection, Brain tumor detection and classification etc.
2. Creating a GUI based application or Web page for easy access of the models.
3. Improving the model performances to achieve higher accuracies and better predictions. 

##### In case of errors, Do make sure to check the requirements and versions of libraries.
