## HEDA - Your Health App
### Diagnostics at your doorsteps

HEDA is Python Script that helps predict the chances of diabetes, malaria or heart disease based on the given criteria. Diabetes and Heart disease prediction models take in numbers as input while Malaria model inputs in Cell images for prediction. 

All the models and their notebooks along with datasets have been stored in different folders for ease of access.
The input for malaria prediction should be a valid path in order for the code to run. 

The Diabetes model helps predict the possibility of diabetes using criterias like Age, BMI, Glucose levels, Skin Thickness, Diabetes Pedigree Function etc.
